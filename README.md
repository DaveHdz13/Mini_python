## Magical Hat Sorting

This Python code emulates the magical sorting hat from the world of Harry Potter, determining which Hogwarts house best suits the user based on their preferences.

### Code Description

The code begins by initializing a dictionary called `houses` with four Hogwarts houses (Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin) and setting their initial points to 0.

Next, the code prompts the user to choose between Dawn and Dusk. Depending on the user's choice, points are allocated to Gryffindor and Ravenclaw, or Hufflepuff and Slytherin.

The user is then asked to envision how they'd like to be remembered after their passing. Based on their choice, additional points are assigned to the respective houses.

Finally, the user selects an instrument that pleases their ear the most, and points are distributed accordingly.

The code calculates which house has accumulated the most points and announces the winning house.

### Usage
